## Description

This is a project in Python I did for one of our courses at Alzahra University alongside another student. 
The goal was to learn about Image Processing.


### Preparing Images

First, we uploaded images and reduced their size by 30%. Then we improve the images' contrast, denoised, and used thresholding operations them.

### Preparing Dataset

We chosed three features from each image to create our dataset:

### Machine Learning

We used the Decision Tree algorithm to divide our dataset into test and train sections and defined a classification problem on them. 
Here is the result:
